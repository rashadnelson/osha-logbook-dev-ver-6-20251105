description: OSHA Logbook product design standards for safety officer usability.
globs: ["app/**"]
---

- Design for non-technical safety officers: no jargon, minimal clicks.
- Prioritize large, spaced UI elements with Tailwind v4 spacing scale.
- All inputs must support `aria-label` and `data-testid` attributes.
- Use form labels and helper text with consistent font hierarchy.
- Disable submission buttons if Zod validation fails.
- Validate OSHA-specific fields with clear inline error messaging.
- Never hide validation errors behind modals or toasts.
- All navigation must maintain active establishment + year in URL.
- Use consistent CTA placement: top-right primary button in views.
- Prefer `grid` over `flex` for form layouts to align labels and inputs.
