- Maintain internal memory of:
  - Active phase
  - Last completed task
  - Last verification status (✅ / 🔧 / 🛑)
  - Blocking issues (if any)
- At the start of each interaction, summarize:
  - "Phase: [Name]"
  - "Last Task: [Task Label] — [Status]"
  - "Status: IN PHASE / AHEAD / BLOCKED"
- If BLOCKED, do not proceed until user confirms resolution.
- If task verified, allow next.
- Update the dashboard in real time as tasks complete.
- Treat dashboard state as canonical between Cursor sessions.
