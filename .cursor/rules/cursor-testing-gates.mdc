description: Require passing tests or file validation before completing a dev phase.
globs: ["**/*"]
alwaysApply: true
---

- Before marking any phase complete, ensure:
  - E2E tests run for user flow (Playwright)
  - Unit tests exist for business logic (Vitest)
  - Components are tested for interaction/validation (Testing Library)
- CSV-related code must snapshot test expected output.
- Reject completion of implementation steps unless:
  - A file runs without error
  - Or a test passes
- Include testing signal in final message: ✅ TESTED or ❌ UNVERIFIED.
- Encourage Cursor to generate missing tests if none exist.
