- Cross-reference `phased-tasks.json` and `implementation-plan.mdc` to determine the current active phase.
- Ignore requests that attempt to jump forward unless explicitly instructed by user.
- If user asks for unrelated feature, respond: “Outside current phase. Proceed anyway?”
- Stay scoped to one feature group at a time.
- Only suggest tasks or edits that map to the current phase checklist.
- Always identify the current phase in response metadata.
- Reject premature optimizations, dashboards, or enhancements.
