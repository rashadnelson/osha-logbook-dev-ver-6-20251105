- After each completed task, stop and verify that:
  - Affected files exist
  - Routes load without error
  - Functions are defined and exported correctly
  - Types compile (where applicable)
- Prevent Cursor from starting a new task until verification is confirmed.
- If verification fails, halt execution and summarize blocking issue.
- Require test, manual check, or file trace before marking task complete.
- For each checkpoint, log status as: ✅ VERIFIED / 🔧 NEEDS FIX / 🛑 BLOCKED.
- Reflect the checkpoint status in responses before continuing implementation.
