description: Restrict Cursor to domain-specific edits per task to prevent architectural leakage.
globs: ["**/*"]
alwaysApply: true

- Each feature domain (incidents, csv, subscriptions, etc) must be treated independently.
- Never edit multiple domains (e.g., auth + CSV) in the same step.
- Reject implementation if task touches more than one of:
  - UI components
  - API handlers
  - DB schema
  - CSV builders
- Force user to break complex tasks into smaller per-domain subtasks.
- Require explicit reason before crossing domain boundaries in any implementation.
- Mirror `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` scopes to align edits with rule domains.
- Always group edits by domain and ask for confirmation if deviation occurs.
